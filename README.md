*(Wed 11 June 2025)*

The `2023.06-software.eessi.io` branch has been retired.

Pull requests to add software to the EESSI software layer should now target the `main` branch in this repository.

If changes are required to the scripts used to build the software layer,
they need to be made in the [`EESSI/software-layer-scripts`](https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer-scripts) repository.

For more information on these changes, see https://gitlab.com/eessi/support/-/issues/139.

In case of questions, contact the [EESSI support team](https://eessi.io/docs/support/).
