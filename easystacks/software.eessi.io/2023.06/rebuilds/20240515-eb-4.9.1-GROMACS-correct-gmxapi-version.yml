# Originally shipped version forgot to bump the gmxapi version and source
# tarball, it was still using an older version from the 2023.3 tarball. Looking
# at https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/blob/v2024.1/python_packaging/gmxapi/src/gmxapi/version.py?ref_type=tags#L68,
# the 2024.1 release includes gmxapi 0.5.0.
#
# This also introduced a new build dependency on scikit-build-core for GROMACS
#
# See https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/20522
