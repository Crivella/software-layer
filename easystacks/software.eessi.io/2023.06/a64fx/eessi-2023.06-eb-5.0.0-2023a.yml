        # Siesta testsuite fails in Deucalion's a64fx EESSI build environment
        # but skipping the tests during build and then running them with the
        # installed module works, so skipping the tests only in this case
        # (the test command is triggered via `buildopts` in the easyconfig,
        # so we clear it)
        try-amend: buildopts=""
